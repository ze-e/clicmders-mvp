# About My Goats:
Now I'm writing a blog for the next two years that is going to be about the goats and goats of the future of the animal trade and human rights. There would be a blog as well to share the benefits of my goats as well as their plight and the importance of caring for others because they are human beings, I'm posting them when it's needed as well as the benefits because there is little else the way the people around me do. I'm posting to fill the gap left by the years of abuse and neglect and the need for people to care for them as well as what was left in the world out on the streets.

The post will be very simple but I'm sure you already knew about some of the benefits I'm making possible and the importance to them. It's going to make a huge difference to everyone involved to get them better and help them better and keep their lives going for many years.

The people who are making the post have created my blog on behalf of my family. I hope this is something that everyone from you all could read and see, and especially everyone that knows me about the way I look at them and who is interested in trying to become better and the value that is being added by sharing my story and learning
